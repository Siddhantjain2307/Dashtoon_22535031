The Comic Art Generator is a web application that enables users to effortlessly create and share captivating 10-panel comic strips using the DALL·E API. This user-friendly interface leverages state-of-the-art text-to-image capabilities, transforming textual narratives into visually engaging comic panels.

## Getting Started

Please note that leaving a panel text empty will result in 'Panel text is empty' for that particular panel.
