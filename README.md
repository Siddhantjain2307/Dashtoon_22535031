## About Comic Art Generator

The Comic Art Generator is a creative tool that merges the power of storytelling with the cutting-edge DALL·E API. Users can input text prompts for each of the 10 comic panels, and the application dynamically generates corresponding visual representations using the DALL·E text-to-image conversion.

## Getting Started

To use the Comic Art Generator, follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for running this project.
2. Enter text for each of the 10 comic panels using the input form.
3. Click the "Generate Comic" button to initiate the text-to-image conversion process.
4. Witness the magic as the API transforms your text into vibrant comic panels.
5. Share your creatively generated comic strip with others.

Please note that leaving a panel text empty will result in 'Panel text is empty' for that particular panel.

## How APIs Work

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows one software application to interact with another. In the case of the Comic Art Generator, the DALL·E API is utilized for text-to-image conversion. The API key provided in the project allows seamless communication between the web application and the DALL·E model hosted on the cloud.
